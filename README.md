# Woad
World of Auction Data.

## Why does this exist?
1) Needed to get practice with python and SQL. 

2) Noted that the people who see World of Warcraft as an investment vehicle or economic simulator often use analogies from securities markets in order to interpret the market. However, WoW has no market makers, the market behaves very differently than securities exchanges. This project is intended to provide an alternative to traditional OHLC data visualisation in the form of grouped box-plots with "jitter" overlays common in network traffic visualisations.
